# JUNIT_Testing
My work in software testing, automation, and quality assurance. 

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

There are several different ways to ensure that my code is functional and secure. Relative to static and dynamic testing. Anything written down can be analyzed with static testing. The static testing can involve code reviews to correct any errors in thought or understanding. Also, J Unit testing is a great way to ensure that the working code meets the software specifications.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

The user needs can be translated into use cases. Stated, use cases are actions performed by the user. They are derived from a statement that categorizes the type of user, the action they want to perform, and the added business value to the product. 

How do I approach designing software?

My approach to designing software is an adaptation of computational thinking. I began with requirements decomposition. Analyzing and separating the requirements into two categories (functional and non-functional). Next, I look for any patterns in the data, user actions, and/or system requirements. Afterwards, the patterns are grouped together. Finally, writing pseudocode is a great way to develop a set of instructions. The process facilitates creativity, time complexity analysis, and sound decision logic.
